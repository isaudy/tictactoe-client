# Tic Tac Toe: 80's Arcade Edition #

This application lets the user play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe on a nostalgic
user interface.

**Planning Story:**
I had to take this project one chapter at a time.  I had initially planned on
creating my HTML and moving on from there, however, I was going back and editing
it right up until my last commit earlier today.  Working through the Game Project
API, I was able to break apart the requirements into multiple days.  This gave
me the opportunity to go back and tweak, edit and update as needed while still
getting the major functionality out of the way.  I knew that the indexing was going
to be one of the more complex parts of this process so I saved that process towards
the end and made sure to get my API's hooked up ASAP.

**User Stories:**
- as a child user, I want to play a game on my mom's phone because I'm
bored.
- as a user who doesn't speak English, I want to play a game that doesn't
heavily rely on text.
- as an actor waiting off stage for my queue, I want a game I can close
quickly but resume at a later day or time.
- as a doctor who just finished a high-stakes surgery, I want a game
that has a cheerful and easy UI so that I can relax.

**Technologies Used:**
- jQuery & Javascript
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Ajax

**Unsolved Problems:**
Still need to figure out how to properly log index when clicking on individual
boxes and would like to eventually have improved CSS.
